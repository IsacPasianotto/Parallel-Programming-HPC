# Jacobi method for solving Laplace equation

## Description

This folder contains my solution for the given task: taking an already existing code, in this case the [`original_code.c`](./original_code.c) and porting it to the GPU.
To do so I've used the `openACC` library. Moreover, the code has also been modified to implement also `MPI`, in order to distribute the computation among multiple nodes.
